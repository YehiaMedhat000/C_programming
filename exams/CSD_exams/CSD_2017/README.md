### Question 1 ⌨️
---
Write a program that outputs the Nth term of the Fibonacci series:\
$F_1 = 1, F_2 = 2$, and $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n > 2.$

The first terms of this series are: $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...$\
The user enters n (index of the term be shown), and the program outputs the number.\
```
Example.1:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```
```
Example.2:
Input: n = 8
Output: 21
```


### Question 2 ⌨️
Given an integer x and base b, draw a flowchart and write a program to convert x
to an equivalent base-b number. Hint: b takes values from 2 to 9 only.

```
Exmaple.1:
Input: x = 13
        b = 2
Output: 1101
```
```
Exmaple.2:
Input: x = 13
        b = 8
Output: 15
```

### Question 3 ⌨️
Given two sorted arrays, draw a flowchart and write a program that
merges the two array into one sorted array.
Your program should read the size and elements of each input array.
You may assume the maximum size of all arrays in the program is 100.

```
Input: n1 = 4
    array1 = {1, 3, 7, 8}
    n2 = 3
    array2 = {2, 4, 5}
Output: array3 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
```
